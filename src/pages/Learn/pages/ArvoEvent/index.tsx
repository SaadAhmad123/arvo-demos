              Modern software systems require reliable communication mechanisms between components to function effectively. While 
              traditional architectures rely on synchronous patterns like function calls or API requests, event-driven systems use 
              self-contained messages called events to enable asynchronous communication. These machine-readable data structures 
              flow through event brokers, allowing producers and consumers to operate independently and scale efficiently.

              Event-driven architecture offers significant advantages in resource utilization and scalability. Unlike synchronous 
              systems where components must wait for responses while holding open connections, event handlers can process messages 
              and immediately release computational resources. This design enables systems to scale horizontally and handle variable 
              workloads more effectively. However, this flexibility introduces substantial challenges in maintaining consistent event 
              structures across evolving systems, as different teams and components often develop incompatible formats optimized for 
              their specific needs.

            # The ArvoEvent

            Arvo addresses the standardization challenge through the \`ArvoEvent\` specification, which extends the
            [CNCF CloudEvent](https://cloudevents.io/) standard rather than introducing entirely new conventions. By 
            building on this widely-adopted foundation, \`ArvoEvent\` ensures compatibility with existing \`CloudEvents\`-compliant 
            infrastructure while adding essential capabilities for Arvo-based event routing and OpenTelemetry distributed tracing. 
            This approach allows Arvo-based systems to integrate seamlessly with the broader CloudEvents ecosystem while providing 
            the enhanced functionality needed for sophisticated event-driven architectures.              

            ## The Anatomy of ArvoEvent

            The following table provides a comprehensive overview of \`ArvoEvent\` fields, their classification, and 
            the rationale behind their inclusion in the event structure.
