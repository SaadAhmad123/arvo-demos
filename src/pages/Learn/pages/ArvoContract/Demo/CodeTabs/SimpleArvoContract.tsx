    While \`createArvoContract\` provides complete flexibility for complex service interfaces, 
    many services follow straightforward request-response patterns. The \`createSimpleArvoContract\` 
    factory streamlines contract creation for these common scenarios by applying opinionated 
    conventions while maintaining full type safety and validation capabilities.

    The simple contract factory automatically structures your contract with standardized event 
    type patterns, eliminating boilerplate while ensuring consistency across your system. Rather 
    than explicitly defining multiple emit types, you specify a single success schema, and the 
    factory handles event type generation according to established conventions.

    **Convention patterns applied by the simple contract factory:**

    - The accepts event type follows the pattern \`com.{type}\`, establishing the service entry point. 
    - The success emit type follows \`evt.{type}.success\`, providing a consistent success signal 
    across services. 
    - The system error type, automatically included in all contracts, follows 
    \`sys.com.{type}.error\` for standardized error handling.
    
    The **created contracts remain complete \`ArvoContract\` instances** with access to the full contract 
    API. The only difference lies in their creation methodâ€”the simple factory enforces conventions 
    that the base factory leaves open for customization. This approach works exceptionally well 
    for services with binary success-or-error outcomes, such as payment processing, data validation, 
    or external API integrations.
