              # The Event Subject

              The \`subject\` field in \`ArvoEvent\` serves as a persistent workflow identifier 
              that remains constant across all events within a single workflow execution. 
              This unique identifier establishes the connection between related events, 
              enabling \`ArvoOrchestrator\` and \`ArvoResumable\` handlers to manage workflow state and 
              coordinate progression across distributed service boundaries.

              Since all workflow events originate from the same initiating source, subsequent events within that workflow

              preserve parent workflow context when initializing nested orchestrations. This pattern is detailed in

              to the key-value store using the same \`subject\` key. This cycle repeats for each incoming event, with

              While the \`subject\` field represents a powerful mechanism for contextual

              potential misuse that undermines system design principles. You must exercise

              - Storing detailed information in a dedicated data plane and referencing it through a compact key
              - Utilizing the data field for comprehensive contextual information
              - Employing dedicated metadata management services that can be referenced through lightweight identifiers

              # Distributed Tracing & System Observability

              System observability in distributed event-driven architectures presents unique challenges, 
              particularly in tracing events as they flow between multiple services. Arvo addresses this 
              challenge through native integration with OpenTelemetry, implementing distributed tracing 
              through two critical event extensions: 

              - \`traceparent\` 
              - \`tracestate\`

              The \`traceparent\` field carries the core OpenTelemetry context, including **trace ID, span ID, and trace flags**, 
              maintaining the connection between different spans as events traverse service boundaries. 
              Meanwhile, the \`tracestate\` field supports vendor-specific tracing information, allowing 
              organisations to include additional context while remaining compatible with the OpenTelemetry 
              specification. This implementation ensures that when an event leaves one handler and moves to 
              another, the tracing context seamlessly transfers, maintaining an unbroken chain of observability 
              across the entire system.

              Arvo implements an elegant and powerful event routing system leveraging the self describing 
              \`ArvoEvent\` that facilitate message distribution while maintaining service independence. 
              At its core, the routing mechanism revolves around three fundamental \`ArvoEvent\` fields: \`to\`, 
              \`source\`, and \`redirectto\`. These fields work in concert to create a flexible yet predictable

              It uses a reverse-DNS format (e.g., \`com.company.service\`) to identify destination services. 
              While the \`to\` field should often match an event's type, they can differ to support more

              serves as the return address for responses. Every handler in Arvo has a unique source 
              identifier that serves two purposes:

              - As a receiving address when matching against incoming events' \`to\` fields
              - As the default \`to\` field for any events the handler emits

              This dual role creates clear event trails and enables automatic response routing. 
              You can access a handler's source through the \`handler.source\` property, as all Arvo handlers 
              inherit from \`AbstractArvoEventHandler\` and have a consistent interface.
