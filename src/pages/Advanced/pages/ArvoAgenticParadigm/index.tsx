              Arvo's agentic paradigm takes a different approach than frameworks like LangGraph or protocols like MCP. 
              It's an event-driven toolkit that provides application-tier constructs for building reliable event driven 
              applications inTypeScript. Its **event-driven nature naturally enables truly agentic behavior**.


              Understanding Arvo's agentic paradigm requires a mindset shift. Agency (the AI Agentic behaviour) isn't 
              a special feature bolted onto Arvo rather it emerges organically from its design. **AI Agent
              isn't a separate components in the toolkit; it a pattern derived from Arvo's primitives.**
              This deliver genuinely agentic systems with enterprise-grade observability, scalability, 
              reliability, evolvability, and security. Since agents are just event handlers with specific
              agentic logic and intelligence, they integrate seemlessly within the Arvo's event-driven fabric.

              The true power of Arvo's agentic paradigm emerges from the seamless composition of 
              these handler types. Intelligent agentic orchestrators coordinate with deterministic 
              workflows and leverage external tool using agents, all communicating through the unified 
              event-driven fabric. The result is an architectural pattern where agentic intelligence, deterministic reliability, 
              and external integration work in concert within a cohesive event-driven system.

              ## What are you building?

              Let's explore agentic implementation in Arvo by creating factory functions for 
              two core agent types: 

              - **Agentic Resumables** which are the agentic orchestrators
              - **MCP Agents** which are MCP connected agents

              These factories encapsulate common agentic logic and return fully configured event handlers ready to 
              participate in Arvo's fabric. You'll then build AI agents and integrate them into Arvo's event-driven system.

              > **Recommendation:** It is strongly encouraged that yoy copy the factory methods and accompanying files into your codebase and start 
              > building AI agents. The following code is production-ready and follows the **shadcn philosophy** of

              Arvo takes a pragmatic stance on agentic development. **AI agents are not the centerpiece of the system**, but

              The factory and integration patterns may initially appear sophisticated, but they are intentionally designed for ease of use and flexibility. 
              They are provided so that you as developer can copy them directly into your projects, gaining both immediate productivity
